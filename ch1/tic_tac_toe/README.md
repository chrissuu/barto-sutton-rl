The first chapter of *Reinforcement Learning* by Barto and Sutton is quite ambiguous by nature of it being an introduction to Reinforcement Learning.

However, as I progress through the textbook, I thought that the "Tic-Tac-Toe" example was interesting enough to take the given pseudocode and make it into a worked out example.
